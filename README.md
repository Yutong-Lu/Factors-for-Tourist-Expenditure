# Factorial Design for Factors Affecting Total Tourist Expenditure

## Introduction
- Aims to investigate the influence of foreign nationality, family travel, first-time visits, and activity level on total tourist expenditure.
- Literature supports these factors' significance in tourist spending post-pandemic.

## Materials and Methods
- Employs a 2^4 factorial design with two blocks, each with two levels per factor.
- Constructed five replicates to estimate error and used a partial confounded approach.
- Data simulation was based on literature evidence with random errors added for each combination.

## Statistical Analysis
- Applied linear regression models to evaluate main effects, interactions, and block effects.
- Employed ANOVA to analyze variance, identifying significant factors influencing tourist expenditure.
- Checked model assumptions through residual plots and Normal quantile-quantile plots.

## Results and Discussion
- Found that foreign nationality, family travel, first-time visits, activity level, and their interactions significantly impact total tourist expenditure.
- Identified significant effects via p-values and validated assumptions through residual and quantile-quantile plots.

## Conclusion
- Confirms the significance of foreign nationality, family travel, first-time visits, activity level, and their interactions in influencing total tourist expenditure.
- Literature evidence, design, and simulation align with the observed impacts on tourist spending.
